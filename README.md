## 📖 Description

**Zuan Kernel Manager (ZKM)** is an advanced Android kernel management tool, rebuilt from the legendary Rve Kernel Manager project base.

This project was born from the desire to perfect the user experience. We have performed extensive rewrites and modifications to deliver a much more modern user interface (UI), eye-pleasing themes, and stability improvements across various sectors. ZKM is not just a rebranding, but an evolution with richer features and code optimization for more responsive performance.
